# New genes linked to breast cancer risk in East Asians
Three genetic changes that confer risk of breast cancer in East Asian women are reported in a paper published online this week at Nature Genetics. The results provide new insight into the genetics of breast cancer in an under-studied population.

Most research on breast cancer has focused on samples from women of European ancestry. Qiuyin Cai and colleagues studied a group of over 22,000 East Asian women with breast cancer to locate possible Asian-specific genetic changes that can lead to the disease. They found DNA sequence changes near three genes, ARRDC3, PRC1 and ZC3H11A. Two of the sequence changes were found in parts of the genome that regulate how other nearby genes are expressed.

ARRDC3 and PRC1 mutations were previously linked to breast cancer growth and poor survival in breast cancer patients, respectively. The role of ZC3H11A in breast cancer is unknown.

# MED12 mutations found in breast fibroadenomas
Mutations in a gene that can cause breast fibroadenomas - benign breast tumors - are reported in a study published online this week in Nature Genetics. The results point to a common underlying cause for both breast fibroadenomas and benign tumors of the uterus known as uterine leiomyomas.

Fibroadenomas of the breast are non-cancerous tumors that commonly occur in the breasts of women under the age of 30. The genetic cause of these tumors is not known. Bin Tean Teh and colleagues sequenced the genes of eight fibroadenoma samples and compared them to normal tissue from the same women. They found mutations in the gene MED12 in four of the eight samples. The researchers sequenced the MED12 gene in another 90 fibroadenoma samples and found that 50 carried mutations.

MED12 is one of several genes that interact with estrogen receptors. The only other tumor type that has similar mutations in MED12 is uterine leiomyoma, another female-specific benign tumor.
